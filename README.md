# Timestamp_Party
Prepare yourself for the timestamp 1 500 000 000 on Friday July 14 2017 04:40:00 GMT, next round timestamp will be in 2038 so why not celebrate this one?

This little repository aims to celebrate this super round timestamp through many very simple programs in as much language as possible.

You want to try the bot?
Open [Telgram](https://telegram.org/), message `@default_sandbox_bot` and send `/alert_me` (works only if the bot is up, otherwise, you won't receive any answer)
